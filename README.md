this project is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings.The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment..

# UI/UX Design Planning
- Design Goals
My aim is to deliver an intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing user interface for an accommodation booking web application inspired by AirBnB.

 Key design goals include:

Create an intuitive booking flow that minimizes user effort.

Maintain visual consistency using a defined color scheme and typography.

Ensure fast load times for better performance.

Prioritize a mobile-first, responsive design for seamless use on all devices.

- Key Features
To meet these goals, the UI/UX will implement:

Property Search & Filtering: Users can search for properties and apply filters like location, price, and amenities.

Detailed Property View: Comprehensive property pages with high-quality images, amenities, and booking options.

Secure Checkout: A smooth, step-by-step booking and payment process.

User Authentication: Sign up, sign in, and manage personal bookings securely.

- Primary Pages
Page Name	Description
Property Listing View	A grid display of available properties, including a search bar and filters for refining results. Each property card shows an image, price, location, and rating.
Listing Detailed View	A single property’s full details: photo gallery, description, amenities, reviews, and a booking form for selecting dates and guests.
